# Time-Series-Prediction-LSTM-KERAS
An approach to LSTM RNN using Python and Keras


We will work on time series, a difficult type of predictive modeling problem. We choose this because will give us everything we need in order to solve easier problems.

The most difficult part is that time series add the complexity of sequence dependence among the input variables.

LSTM or Long Short-Term Memory network is a type of RNN( Recurrent Neural Network) used in a deep learning. RNNs are a powerful type of neural network able to handle sequence dependence.
